# react-schwanz-ui

Reusable React UI components with a hard dependency on Tailwind CSS.

To use, it is recommended that you import this module's stylesheet.
Be sure to include it after `@tailwind utilities`.

```
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@import "/path/to/node_modules/react-schwanz-ui/dist/index.css";
```

Then, import any of the components as you normally would.

```
import {Button} from 'react-schwanz-ui
```
