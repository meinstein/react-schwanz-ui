# react-schwanz-ui

Reusable React UI components with a hard dependency on Tailwind CSS.

To use, it is recommended that you import this module's stylesheet like so:

```
@import "tailwindcss/base";
@import "tailwindcss/components";
@import "tailwindcss/utilities";

@import "react-schwanz-ui/dist/index.css";
```

Then, import any of the components as you normally would.

```
import {Button} from 'react-schwanz-ui
```
